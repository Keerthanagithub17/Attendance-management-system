Attendance Management System
A lightweight, web-based attendance tracker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Allows marking students as Present or Absent, maintains mutually exclusive lists, displays total counts, and persists data using browser localStorage—all without any backend or database. Ideal for demonstrating dynamic DOM manipulation and front-end logic in a real-world scenario.
